<h2>ABOUT</h2>
This repo consists of 4 branches till now.
<li><b>Main</b> : I extracted this code from Nitin's YT channel and it gave some error, which I was not aware of so I gave up on this code and started looking for other tutorials. I looked at this code after going through many tutorials and realised that it is very similar to the ML mastery code that I understood and started implementing in the new branches.</li>

<h2>DATASET</h2>
The dataset being used in all the branches is Flickr8k dataset
It consists of 6k training images
1k validation images
1k testing images
Every image has 5 corresponding captions to it.
The model used is VGG-16 pretrained model - <u>Visual Geometry Group</u>
16 represents the # of weight layers in the model.
It is a CNN based model containing 3X3 convolutional layers stacked on top of each other in increasing depth.

<h2>RESOURCES</h2>
More advanced model will be Resnet which can be trained upto 200 layers deep.
