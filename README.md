<h2>DATASET</h2>
1. The dataset being used in all the branches is Flickr8k dataset
2.  It consists of 6k training images
3.  1k validation images
4.  1k testing images
5.  Every image has 5 corresponding captions to it.
6.  The model used is VGG-16 pretrained model - <u>Visual Geometry Group</u>
7. 16 represents the # of weight layers in the model.
8.  It is a CNN based model containing 3X3 convolutional layers stacked on top of each other in increasing depth.

<h2>RESOURCES</h2>
9.  More advanced model will be Resnet which can be trained upto 200 layers deep.
